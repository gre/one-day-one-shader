It might not be very perceptible but it is basically 150 parametric functions projected on different scales. The idea comes a bit from the &quot;Planet holes&quot; idea (<a href=\"/plots/100\">plot#100</a>) that you have a circle with different radius but applied to parametric function.</p>\n<p>I might not have taken the best parametric for the exercice but it&#39;s still fun. Unfortunately, the pen digged a bit too much in the paper and I might try again with other parametric functions in future.</p>\n<p>The ink used is &quot;Bloody Brexit&quot; by Diamine, like on <a href=\"/plots/109\">plot#109</a>, which produces interesting reflection in combination with a good paper and lamp.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/bloodybrexit.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n","data":{"title":"Growing parametric","thumbnail":"/images/plots/111.jpg","tags":["parametric"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
