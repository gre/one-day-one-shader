It kinda looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">for a in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor b in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor c in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor d in 0.5 1 2 4; do\n  sh $P/gen.sh --a $a --b $b --c $c --d $d\n  cp ./results/out.gif out/${a}_${b}_${c}_${d}.gif\ndone\ndone\ndone\ndone\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I kept refining my &quot;range&quot; by fail and retry. It is quite slow to generate them so it&#39;s a long process.</p>\n<p>When I was satisfied by the parameters, I then switch to a second selection: the selection of the seed! because my noise have seed and can generate very different kind of noises, I put it against my &quot;elector&quot; homemade tool as explained on <a href=\"/plots/143\">plot#143</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-selection.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<h2 id=\"some-highlight-of-the-rustlang-code\">Some highlight of the Rustlang code</h2>\n<p>There is nothing really &quot;new&quot; from my previous plots, especially all the parametric plot when I started this &quot;growing parametric&quot; exploration between <a href=\"/plots/114\">plot#114</a> and <a href=\"/plots/148\">plot#148</a>.</p>\n<p>What is new here however is the use of a GIF as an input. It&#39;s very easy to do: my script takes basically an loop percentage which I can transpose to looking up a frame in the rotating dancer loop.
